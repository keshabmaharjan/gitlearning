Step 1: First this we need to create the repository in the github.com clicking little plus sign in the 
right hand corner of the web page.

Step 2: Then be in the appropriate drive where you want to clone the repository into your local machine
just in my case it is suppose to be in "C:\Users\dell>"
Command 1:
C:\Users\dell>git clone https://github.com/keshabmaharjan/gitlearning.git
Cloning into 'gitlearning'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
--this command will clone the repository of the remote to your local machine folder "C:\Users\dell\"

--check if there is folder or not 
C:\Users\dell>cd gitlearning

--check with the dir command , and you will see there is the empty repository or the folder.
C:\Users\dell\gitlearning>dir

--adding file to the stagging before we send it to the remote. 
C:\Users\dell\gitlearning>git add helloworld.txt

--now commiting the file with the message of "git clone command" <- writing these sort of msg is for our refrence.
C:\Users\dell\gitlearning>git commit -m "git clone command"

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
